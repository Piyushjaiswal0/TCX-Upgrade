1. When developing workflows do not make changes directly to any out of the box workflows. This will likely result in regressions during application change as your workflow will be overwritten

2. Use conditions to apply visibility changes to out of the box workflows if appropriate which can be reapplied after application change. You must consider how these will be re-applied to maintain the workflow visibility rules you require through application change

3. When developing workflows do not use custom handlers as these will not be supported without advance agreement

4. All workflows should have a test case describing all major test paths. For internal development the test case should be in APE, for those without APE access the test case must be written in a document with the workflow name clearly stated in the 998-Test_Scripts folder

5. If there is specific data required for testing workflows, this should be uploaded into the 997-Test_Data folder in a format which can be used to place the appropriate test cases into Teamcenter

6. Workflows must be tested in TEST environments using the test scripts before deploying to UAT
